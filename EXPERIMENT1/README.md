# Experiment 1: Sequential Matrix Multiplication

## Objective

To implement and execute sequential matrix multiplication for two 4000 × 4000 matrices using C and GCC, and measure the execution time of the sequential computation.

## Description

In this experiment, two 4000 × 4000 matrices, A and B, are initialized with the value 1.0 for all elements.

The matrix multiplication is performed sequentially using three nested loops. The resulting matrix C is calculated as:

C = A × B

Since every element of matrices A and B is 1.0, each element of the resulting matrix C is expected to be 4000.00.

The program was written in C, compiled using GCC with optimization enabled, and executed inside the WSL Ubuntu environment.

## Compilation

The program was compiled using:

```bash
gcc -O2 seq.c -o seq

Result

The sequential matrix multiplication was completed successfully.

Matrix Size: 4000 × 4000
Execution Time: 278.401353 seconds
Verification C[0][0]: 4000.00
Conclusion

The sequential matrix multiplication program was successfully compiled and executed. The calculated verification value C[0][0] = 4000.00 confirms that the matrix multiplication produced the expected result.

The measured execution time for the 4000 × 4000 matrix multiplication was 278.401353 seconds.
